# Lumap

Lumap is a live video projection/mapping software.
I have been inspirated by QLab.

## Stable version installation
If you want a stable version of lumap, you can just download the lumap.exe file and run it on your computer.
Note that this file works on a 64bits Intel CPU Windows computer. Other versions are coming, please be patient !

## Beta version installation
This version of lumap is unstable cause it's under developement. If you want, you can install it by cloning this repo and running :
`pip3 install python-tk pygame opencv-python pillow pyautogui bottle`.
Note that pyautogui and bottle are only needed for the remote control fonctionnality.
If you don't want to use it, you can just remove the two imports of these libs in the PY file and there will be no need to install them.
